# Architecture Design Record

# [Decision record  by Hector Plinio](https://github.com/hectorplinio).

# Choose type of API that we will used
_For this project we need to choose one type of API that we will use to communicate companies, offer-jobs and employees._
_In my opinion the best type of API is REST because for working with data is the best option. One of the main features of REST Web services is the explicit use of HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) methods. GET, POST, PUT and DELETE._

## Framework for making REST APIs

_We need to work with some framework to streamline our work and procedures. I think the best option is to use Express because it is the most widespread and popular framework in nodeJs. It has a wide variety of resources and a great community as well, all this will make our work easier._

_If we use Express afterwards, we can use some middleware that is in the Express community._

## Database

_We are reaching the moment of choosing the database service, this is an important decision that will mark the future of the project. I personally think MongoDB is a good choice because this database has more advantages than disadvantages. Some advantages:_

- _It is ideal for environments with few computing resources._
- _It is a low cost tool._
- _It has great documentation._
- _It is a perfect plugin for JavaScript._
- _If we need it, we can use MongoDb Atlas._

## Final decision

- _Type of API: REST API._
- _Framework: Express._
- _Database: MongoDB._
