# Crypt vs Crypto-js

_Crypto has 14 stars in npm trends but the biggest problem is that its last update is 5 years ago. It has about 8M downloads at this moment and this is the best option to encrypt our password before saving the user in datable._

_But the problem of its last update in my opinion makes it less secure. I prefer to try the second library which at the moment is crypto-js, it has about 4M downloads and its last update is 8 months old._

# CryptoJS - AES

_This is the way when we use CryptoJS, it is very easy and we can change the format we need to encrypt._

# Conclusion

_In my opinion, I think CryptoJS would be the best choice and it is so easy to use._
